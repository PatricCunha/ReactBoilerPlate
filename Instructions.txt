1 - Clone the project.

2 - If you are creating a new project, delete package.json and run "npm init" on the project's root folder. Alternatively you can run "setup_newproject.bat"/"setup_newproject.sh" and skip step 2 and 3.
 
3 - Run npm install or npm update on the project's root folder, npm will use existing files in node_modules to check if you have the latest versions of these modules installed. This step can usually be skipped, but shouldn't so everyone is using the latest version of the required modules. If there are errors with the modules, you could try installing the modules manually.

//WARNING//
These scripts forcefully install the latest version of modules, this might possibly break your app
in production, consider updating manually in production after testing in dev.
